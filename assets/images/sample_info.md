# Sample Floor Plan Image

To test the room detection functionality, add a sample floor plan image here named:

- `sample_floorplan.png`

You can use any architectural floor plan image in PNG or JPG format. The YOLO model will attempt to detect rectangular room areas in the image.

For best results, use floor plans with:

- Clear room boundaries
- Good contrast between rooms and walls
- Minimal clutter or text overlay
