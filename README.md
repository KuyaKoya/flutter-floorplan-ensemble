### Key Features Deep Dive

#### üîÑ Multi-Model Ensemble

The app automatically loads and combines multiple models:

```dart
ModelConfig(assetPath: 'assets/models/floorplan_v17.2.tflite', weight: 1.0),
ModelConfig(assetPath: 'assets/models/floorplans-seg_v19.tflite', weight: 0.75),
```

- **Weighted averaging** of confidence scores
- **Redundancy** for improved accuracy
- **Fallback support** if one model fails

#### üß© Intelligent Tiling System

For large images, the app automatically:

1. **Splits into 640√ó640 overlapping tiles**
2. **Processes each tile independently**
3. **Transforms coordinates** back to global space
4. **Applies global NMS** to remove duplicates
5. **Merges results** across all tiles

#### üìä Real-time Logging

Comprehensive logging system provides:

- **Model loading progress**
- **Processing pipeline status**
- **Detection counts and confidence scores**
- **Performance metrics and timing**
- **Error handling and debugging info**

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Adaptive Processing

The app automatically recommends processing mode based on:

- **Image dimensions** (threshold: 2000√ó2000 pixels)
- **Available memory**
- **Processing complexity**

### Image Processing Pipeline

#### Preprocessing

- **Format conversion** to RGB if needed
- **Resize** to model input size (640√ó640)
- **Normalization** to [0, 1] range
- **Tensor preparation** for TensorFlow Lite

#### Inference

- **Multi-model execution** in parallel
- **Confidence scoring** with weighted averaging
- **Class filtering** (room detection only)
- **Memory-efficient** batch processing

#### Post-processing

- **Confidence thresholding** (default: 50%)
- **Non-Maximum Suppression** (NMS threshold: 45%)
- **Coordinate scaling** to original image dimensions
- **Bounding box refinement** and validation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Customization

### Detection Parameters

You can adjust detection sensitivity in the service files:

**Confidence Threshold** (in `streamlined_room_detection_service.dart`):

```dart
static const double confidenceThreshold = 0.5;  // Minimum confidence (50%)
```

**NMS Threshold** (for duplicate removal):

```dart
static const double nmsThreshold = 0.45;        // Overlap threshold (45%)
```

**Model Weights** (in `floorplan_detection_screen.dart`):

```dart
ModelConfig(assetPath: 'assets/models/floorplan_v17.2.tflite', weight: 1.0),
ModelConfig(assetPath: 'assets/models/floorplans-seg_v19.tflite', weight: 0.75),
```

### Service Selection

**Manual Override** (in the UI):

- Toggle between "Streamlined" and "Tiled" modes
- App provides recommendations based on image size

**Automatic Selection Threshold**:

```dart
static DetectionServiceType getRecommendedServiceType({
  required int imageWidth,
  required int imageHeight,
  int maxStreamlinedSize = 2000,  // Configurable threshold
})
```

### UI Customization

**Theme Colors** (in `main.dart`):

```dart
theme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
  useMaterial3: true,
),
```

**Detection Overlay** (in `detection_overlay.dart`):

- Bounding box colors and styles
- Confidence score display format
- Label positioning and fonts

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Models Not Loading

**Symptoms:** "Failed to load models" error message

**Solutions:**

- Verify all `.tflite` files exist in `assets/models/`
- Check `pubspec.yaml` includes the assets folder
- Ensure models are not corrupted (download again if needed)
- Check console logs for specific TensorFlow Lite errors

#### 2. No Detections Found

**Symptoms:** "No rooms detected" message with clear floor plans

**Solutions:**

- Lower confidence threshold temporarily: `confidenceThreshold = 0.1`
- Try switching between Streamlined and Tiled modes
- Ensure image shows clear room boundaries and walls
- Check if floor plan is similar to training data (architectural drawings)

#### 3. Poor Detection Accuracy

**Symptoms:** Missing rooms or false positives

**Solutions:**

- Use **Tiled mode** for large, detailed floor plans
- Adjust model weights in the ensemble
- Try different combinations of available models
- Ensure good image quality and resolution

#### 4. App Performance Issues

**Symptoms:** Slow processing or memory errors

**Solutions:**

- Use **Streamlined mode** for smaller images
- Close other apps to free memory
- Test on physical device vs emulator
- Reduce image size before processing

#### 5. PDF Processing Fails

**Symptoms:** Errors when importing PDF files

**Solutions:**

- Ensure PDF contains vector graphics or high-resolution images
- Try converting PDF to image externally first
- Check PDF file is not password-protected
- Verify file size is reasonable (< 50MB recommended)

### Debug Information

The app provides comprehensive logging in the bottom panel:

```text
=== Starting Model Initialization ===
Loading Streamlined Detection (Full Image Resize) models...
‚úì Model loaded: assets/models/floorplan_v17.2.tflite (Weight: 1.0)
‚úì Model loaded: assets/models/floorplans-seg_v19.tflite (Weight: 0.75)
‚úì All models loaded successfully
Models loaded. Select an image or PDF to analyze.
```

**Detection Results Example:**

```text
Detected 3 rooms:
Detection(label: Room, confidence: 0.85, box: [120.0, 50.0, 200.0, 150.0])
Detection(label: Room, confidence: 0.72, box: [350.0, 80.0, 180.0, 120.0])
Detection(label: Room, confidence: 0.68, box: [50.0, 200.0, 150.0, 100.0])
```

### Performance Benchmarks

**Typical Processing Times:**

  serviceType: DetectionServiceType.streamlined,
  modelConfigs: [
    ModelConfig(assetPath: 'assets/models/floorplan_v17.2.tflite', weight: 1.0),
  ],
);

// Load models
await service.loadModels();

// Process image
final detections = await service.processImageFile(imageFile);

// Use results
for (final detection in detections) {
  print('Room found: ${detection.confidence}');
}
```

### Performance Optimization

**For Better Speed:**

- Use Streamlined mode for smaller images
